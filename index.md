Hi, I'm [Manita Pote](https://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan/people/). I am a PhD student in Informatics, Complex Networks and System 
at [Indian University, Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/)
supervised by [Prof. Fil Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil/), 
[Prof. Alessandro Flammini](https://cnets.indiana.edu/aflammin/) and 
[Prof. Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/). 
My research interests are in computational social science and network science. 
I mainly work in coordination detection problem, finding coordinated effort/strategies
used to influence operation in social network. <br />
Check out some of my blogs on computational methods that I use in my research.
