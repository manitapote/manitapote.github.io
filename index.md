Hi, I'm [Manita Pote](https://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan/people/). I am a PhD student in Informatics, Complex Networks and System 
at [Indiana University, Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/)
supervised by [Prof. Fil Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil/), 
[Prof. Alessandro Flammini](https://cnets.indiana.edu/aflammin/) and 
[Prof. Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/). 
My research interests lie in social media data mining to understand abusive user behavior for platform integrity and
in developing machine learning/deep learning tools to curb those behaviors. I primarily focus on the detection of inauthentic coordination, identifying coordinated efforts and strategies used to influence operations on social networks. Check out some of my blogs on the computational methods I use in my research.
