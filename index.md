Hi, I'm [Manita Pote](https://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan/people/). I am a PhD student in Informatics, Complex Networks and System 
at [Indiana University, Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/)
supervised by [Prof. Fil Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil/), 
[Prof. Alessandro Flammini](https://cnets.indiana.edu/aflammin/) and 
[Prof. Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/). 
My research interests lie in social media data mining, computational social science, network science
to understand abusive user behavior for platform integrity and
in developing machine learning/deep learning tools to 
curb those behaviors. I primarily focus on the detection 
of inauthentic coordination, identifying coordinated 
efforts and strategies used in influence operations campaigns
on social networks. Check out some of my blogs on the computational methods I use in my research
