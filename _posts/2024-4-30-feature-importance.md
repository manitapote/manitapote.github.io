#### Understanding Feature Importance in Machine Learning
Feature importance is a step ofmachine learning that involves calculating the score for each feature to establish importance of  each feature in prediciton. The higher the score for a feature, the larger effect it has on the model to predict a certain variables.<br /><br />

Why is feature importance is needed?<br />
- It helps to find irrelevant features of the model.
- Feature importance helps to reduce the dimensionality of the model. Higher scores are kept and lower scores are deleted as they are not important for the model.
- It helps to interpret and communicate the model to other stakeholders. By calculating scores for each feature, we can determine which feature attribute the most to the predicitve power of the model.
