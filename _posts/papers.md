  ##### Findings
  
  External accounts in information operations were central to every stage of the IO's operation, from introudcton to growth and finally to a stage in which amplification of external accounts wa as an important IRA goal. "This research supports Starbird et al's (2019) observation regarding the importance of considering
"the role of online crowds (unwitting and otherwise) in spreading disinformation and political
propaganda" (p. 4)". <br /> <br />
  **Finding 1** : Three sets of IRA thematic accounts (Right Trolls, Left Trolls, and Hashtag Gamers) made extensive use of networked output, throughout the campaign, both internally and externally. <br />
  **Finding 2** : Replies were used primarily early in the life of the troll accounts and early in the campaign. <br />
  **Finding 3** : After this introductory period, the mix shifts to approximately half original content and half external retweets. During this “growth” period, troll accounts substantially increase followers. <br />
 **Finding 4** : In Sep-Oct, 2016, the mix for Left and Right Trolls shifts again to over 90 percent external retweets. <br />
 **Finding 5** : External accounts targeted in this way were thematically aligned with the troll accounts
  
  **Summary** : External accounts were targeted by replying, retweeting during specific timing of the operation. The targeted accounts aligned with the ideology of the troll accounts.
